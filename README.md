## Overview

### The challenge

I changed a little bit the challenge so that the user could select a target date for the countdown, and at the end the app shows up a message and makes a sound.

The original user stories were:

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was really challenging for me, I actually changed a little bit the challenge so that the user could select a target date for the countdown, and at the end the app shows up a message and makes a sound.

I practiced making functions and using events.

### Continued development

There is an issue I couldn't solve which happens when the app runs on a phone browser and it gets minimized, the countdown doesn't stop but continue running with negative numbers.

If anyone can improve the code to fix it or make it better is more than welcome.
